## Verifying the solution functionality

After deploying the ABI package, you can verify its functionality by checking the following:

1. **AWS Management Console**: Log in to your AWS Management Console and navigate to the services that were configured by the ABI. Check if the resources were created and configured as expected.

2. **CloudCheckr Dashboard**: Log in to your CloudCheckr account and check if the AWS account has been credentialed and if the expected data is being pulled in .


**Next:** Choose [Test the Deployment](/test-deployment/index.html) to get started.
