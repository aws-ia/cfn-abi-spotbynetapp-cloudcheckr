* **AWS Built-in**: An AWS Specialization that validates partner solutions that have automated their solution integrations with relevant AWS foundational services for identity, management, security, and operations.
* **AWS Built-in modules**: The GitHub repositories based on AWS Security Reference Architecture (AWS SRA). Modules provide templates for enabling AWS foundational services such as AWS CloudTrail, Amazon GuardDuty, AWS Security Hub, etc.
* **AWS Built-in projects**: The GitHub repositories built by partners in partnership with AWS. While building these projects, partners use the provided AWS Built-in modules to enable AWS services as needed before creating partner-specific assets. The solution contains (1) Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates to automate enablement of both AWS and partner services, and (2) wrappers for most common formats such as CfCT manifest, AWS Service Catalog baselines, and more, so customers can pick and choose from the available services.
* **CloudCheckr**: A cloud management platform that provides a wide range of cloud management features such as cost optimization, security and compliance monitoring, automation, and reporting.
* **IAM role**: An IAM entity in AWS that defines a set of permissions for making AWS service requests. IAM roles are not associated with a specific user or group. Instead, trusted entities assume roles, such as IAM users, applications, or AWS services like Amazon EC2.
* **CloudFormation stacks**: A collection of AWS resources that you can manage as a single unit. You create, update, and delete a collection of resources by creating, updating, and deleting stacks.
